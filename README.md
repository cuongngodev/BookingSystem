# WebBookingSystem

The Booking System is a web-based application designed for a beauty salon to allow clients to easily book, cancel, or reschedule appointments online. The platform provides a user-friendly way for customers to browse available beauty and wellness services, view details such as duration, price, and description, and select a preferred date and time for their appointment.

The system includes a variety of professional services such as Haircut & Styling, Manicure & Pedicure, Facial Treatment, Hair Coloring, and Makeup Session. Each service entry includes key information to help clients make informed decisions before booking.

Users can register for an account, log in securely, and manage their appointments from their profile. The application supports authentication, ensuring that client information and booking data remain secure.

Administrators and salon staff can manage available services, oversee client bookings, and update schedules as needed.
